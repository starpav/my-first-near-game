# my-first-near-game
Step by step creation of the simplest game on Near blockchain.

I use PC with installed OS Ubuntu - https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop,
Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux,
Godot Engine - https://godotengine.org/download

I'm not an experienced developer and if you haven't done blockchain game development before,
then repeating the steps in this tutorial shouldn't be difficult.
I am currently studying blockchain game development and I think my experience will help
newbies like me get their first application up and running on Near blockchain. 

Before we start, I ask you to complete the first steps yourself:
1. Creating a testnet Near account - https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/basics/create-account
2. Installing the near-cli - https://docs.near.org/docs/tools/near-cli#setup
3. Clone or download this repository - https://github.com/svntax/godot-near-sdk

## Features
- User login/logout through the [NEAR web wallet](https://wallet.near.org/).
- Calling view methods on smart contracts.
- Calling change methods on smart contracts.
